# AA-TP1 (Machine Learning 1)

## Overview

This project is developed as part of a Machine Learning course and demonstrates the application of various regression and classification techniques. The project is divided into two main components:

1. **Collision Avoidance in Space:** Utilizing Linear and Polynomial Regression to predict and avoid potential collisions in space environments.
2. **Banknote Fraud Detection:** Implementing Naive Bayes Classifiers to accurately classify and detect fraudulent banknotes.

These components showcase practical applications of Linear and Polynomial Regression as well as Naive Bayes Classification in real-world scenarios.
